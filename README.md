Motivation
==========

I loved to play this arcade game. I've decided to learn Ruby in the efficient way and modyify Space Shooter ðŸš€ to become Arkanoid ðŸŽ®.

Running
=======

You'll need the gosu gem:
```bash
$ gem install gosu
```
Then run the main.rb file:
```bash
$ruby main.rb
```

How to play
===========

* Use the arrow keys to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen horizontally.
* Prevent falling ball from the playing field, attempting to bounce it. 
* The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear.
* When all the bricks are gone, you win!
